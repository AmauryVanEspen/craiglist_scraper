We work on an array of building types, including courthouses, schools, universities, churches, and hospitals, and many of New York's most storied landmarks, from Trinity Church to Grand Central Terminal. Our work embraces all components of the building envelope and underlying structure—facades, roofs, windows, and plazas—and the full complement of materials, from historic terra-cotta to high-performance curtain walls. We’re proud to be an industry leader in crucial practice areas like Local Law 11 inspections and repairs. We've won numerous awards, as well as the loyalty of many of the premier public, corporate, and residential clients in the region.

We offer an array of benefits and growth opportunities: :


Our light-filled Tribeca office is in a landmarked building with 16' high ceilings, 8' tall windows, and stunning views of Manhattan in three directions—not a bad place to spend the work day.

 , New York City's leading professional firm dedicated to the preservation of buildings and infrastructure, is seeking a resourceful, skilled structural engineer or architect with 5 to 6 years of building envelope restoration experience if licensed, and 7 to 10 years' experience if not licensed, to join us as a Project Manager  in executing a growing slate of challenging projects. 

We work on an array of building types, including courthouses, schools, universities, churches, and hospitals, and many of New York's most storied landmarks, from Trinity Church to Grand Central Terminal. Our work embraces all components of the building envelope and underlying structure—facades, roofs, windows, and plazas—and the full complement of materials, from historic terra-cotta to high-performance curtain walls. We’re proud to be an industry leader in crucial practice areas like Local Law 11 inspections and repairs. We've won numerous awards, as well as the loyalty of many of the premier public, corporate, and residential clients in the region. 

You’ll work as part of a small team assigned to projects based on synergies between project requirements and the capabilities of each team member. This arrangement offers employees the dual advantages of a small office experience coupled with access to the centralized resources of a larger firm. You'll be supported by some of the most sophisticated technology in the profession, including proprietary computer systems and applications, advanced photography and image processing, and state-of-the-art, non-destructive diagnostic equipment and techniques. 

Typically, you’ll participate in all phases of a project from inception through completion: proposal, investigation, construction documents, bid negotiation, and construction administration. You'll have the opportunity to see your designs executed in the field and you'll take on greater responsibility and client management as soon as you are ready. 

We offer an array of benefits and growth opportunities: :


Our light-filled Tribeca office is in a landmarked building with 16' high ceilings, 8' tall windows, and stunning views of Manhattan in three directions—not a bad place to spend the work day. We’re easily accessible via public transportation: the A, C, and E Canal Street station connects directly to our building’s lobby. The N, R, 1, and 6 lines are all just a few blocks away. 

If you’re excited about this opportunity, please send us your resume, a cover letter with salary requirements, and a few pages of attachments (maximum of 10MB, please) or link to your portfolio that demonstrates your experience and capabilities.

 , New York City's leading professional firm dedicated to the preservation of buildings and infrastructure, is seeking a resourceful, skilled structural engineer or architect with 5 to 6 years of building envelope restoration experience if licensed, and 7 to 10 years' experience if not licensed, to join us as a Project Manager  in executing a growing slate of challenging projects. 

We work on an array of building types, including courthouses, schools, universities, churches, and hospitals, and many of New York's most storied landmarks, from Trinity Church to Grand Central Terminal. Our work embraces all components of the building envelope and underlying structure—facades, roofs, windows, and plazas—and the full complement of materials, from historic terra-cotta to high-performance curtain walls. We’re proud to be an industry leader in crucial practice areas like Local Law 11 inspections and repairs. We've won numerous awards, as well as the loyalty of many of the premier public, corporate, and residential clients in the region. 

You’ll work as part of a small team assigned to projects based on synergies between project requirements and the capabilities of each team member. This arrangement offers employees the dual advantages of a small office experience coupled with access to the centralized resources of a larger firm. You'll be supported by some of the most sophisticated technology in the profession, including proprietary computer systems and applications, advanced photography and image processing, and state-of-the-art, non-destructive diagnostic equipment and techniques. 

Typically, you’ll participate in all phases of a project from inception through completion: proposal, investigation, construction documents, bid negotiation, and construction administration. You'll have the opportunity to see your designs executed in the field and you'll take on greater responsibility and client management as soon as you are ready. 

We offer an array of benefits and growth opportunities: :


Our light-filled Tribeca office is in a landmarked building with 16' high ceilings, 8' tall windows, and stunning views of Manhattan in three directions—not a bad place to spend the work day. We’re easily accessible via public transportation: the A, C, and E Canal Street station connects directly to our building’s lobby. The N, R, 1, and 6 lines are all just a few blocks away. 

If you’re excited about this opportunity, please send us your resume, a cover letter with salary requirements, and a few pages of attachments (maximum of 10MB, please) or link to your portfolio that demonstrates your experience and capabilities.

We work on an array of building types, including courthouses, schools, universities, churches, and hospitals, and many of New York's most storied landmarks, from Trinity Church to Grand Central Terminal. Our work embraces all components of the building envelope and underlying structure—facades, roofs, windows, and plazas—and the full complement of materials, from historic terra-cotta to high-performance curtain walls. We’re proud to be an industry leader in crucial practice areas like Local Law 11 inspections and repairs. We've won numerous awards, as well as the loyalty of many of the premier public, corporate, and residential clients in the region. 

You’ll work as part of a small team assigned to projects based on synergies between project requirements and the capabilities of each team member.

We offer an array of benefits and growth opportunities: :


Our light-filled Tribeca office is in a landmarked building with 16' high ceilings, 8' tall windows, and stunning views of Manhattan in three directions—not a bad place to spend the work day.

Facade / Building Envelope Project Manager,https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/egr/d/facade-building-envelope-project-manager/7058072439.html,TriBeCa,Commensurate with experience,full-time,"
        
 
 , New York City's leading professional firm dedicated to the preservation of buildings and infrastructure, is seeking a resourceful, skilled structural engineer or architect with 5 to 6 years of building envelope restoration experience if licensed, and 7 to 10 years' experience if not licensed, to join us as a Project Manager  in executing a growing slate of challenging projects. 

We work on an array of building types, including courthouses, schools, universities, churches, and hospitals, and many of New York's most storied landmarks, from Trinity Church to Grand Central Terminal. Our work embraces all components of the building envelope and underlying structure—facades, roofs, windows, and plazas—and the full complement of materials, from historic terra-cotta to high-performance curtain walls. We’re proud to be an industry leader in crucial practice areas like Local Law 11 inspections and repairs. We've won numerous awards, as well as the loyalty of many of the premier public, corporate, and residential clients in the region. 

You’ll work as part of a small team assigned to projects based on synergies between project requirements and the capabilities of each team member. This arrangement offers employees the dual advantages of a small office experience coupled with access to the centralized resources of a larger firm. You'll be supported by some of the most sophisticated technology in the profession, including proprietary computer systems and applications, advanced photography and image processing, and state-of-the-art, non-destructive diagnostic equipment and techniques. 

Typically, you’ll participate in all phases of a project from inception through completion: proposal, investigation, construction documents, bid negotiation, and construction administration. You'll have the opportunity to see your designs executed in the field and you'll take on greater responsibility and client management as soon as you are ready. 

We offer an array of benefits and growth opportunities: :

Facade / Building Envelope Project Manager,https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/egr/d/facade-building-envelope-project-manager/7066782655.html,TriBeCa,Commensurate with experience,full-time,"
        
 
 , New York City's leading professional firm dedicated to the preservation of buildings and infrastructure, is seeking a resourceful, skilled structural engineer or architect with 5 to 6 years of building envelope restoration experience if licensed, and 7 to 10 years' experience if not licensed, to join us as a Project Manager  in executing a growing slate of challenging projects. 

We work on an array of building types, including courthouses, schools, universities, churches, and hospitals, and many of New York's most storied landmarks, from Trinity Church to Grand Central Terminal. Our work embraces all components of the building envelope and underlying structure—facades, roofs, windows, and plazas—and the full complement of materials, from historic terra-cotta to high-performance curtain walls. We’re proud to be an industry leader in crucial practice areas like Local Law 11 inspections and repairs. We've won numerous awards, as well as the loyalty of many of the premier public, corporate, and residential clients in the region. 

You’ll work as part of a small team assigned to projects based on synergies between project requirements and the capabilities of each team member. This arrangement offers employees the dual advantages of a small office experience coupled with access to the centralized resources of a larger firm. You'll be supported by some of the most sophisticated technology in the profession, including proprietary computer systems and applications, advanced photography and image processing, and state-of-the-art, non-destructive diagnostic equipment and techniques. 

Typically, you’ll participate in all phases of a project from inception through completion: proposal, investigation, construction documents, bid negotiation, and construction administration. You'll have the opportunity to see your designs executed in the field and you'll take on greater responsibility and client management as soon as you are ready. 

We offer an array of benefits and growth opportunities: :


Our light-filled Tribeca office is in a landmarked building with 16' high ceilings, 8' tall windows, and stunning views of Manhattan in three directions—not a bad place to spend the work day. We’re easily accessible via public transportation: the A, C, and E Canal Street station connects directly to our building’s lobby. The N, R, 1, and 6 lines are all just a few blocks away. 

If you’re excited about this opportunity, please send us your resume, a cover letter with salary requirements, and a few pages of attachments (maximum of 10MB, please) or link to your portfolio that demonstrates your experience and capabilities. 

With thanks for your interest, please note that only those candidates under consideration will be contacted.
